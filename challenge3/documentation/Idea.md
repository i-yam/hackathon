### Problem
We want to predict if a person is at risk to become long term sick with Human ressource data

#### Hacathon challenge
- wed do not have realistic data -> it's conflciting at a lot of points

### Goal
- Define a set of data which we can use to solve the problem
- create a model that predicts the likelihood of a person for long-term absence given the data

#### Todo
- [ ] Define entry data that could be possible from HR data
- [ ] Generate "realistic" data with our defined columns
- [ ] Write programs to convert the data for useful AI Model
- [ ] Decide / Consider different outputs: True/False, Precentage, Total amount of sick days
- [ ] Create AI model workflow

### Presentation
- describe problem
  - long term sickness comes out of nowhere and is a problem
- show our solution
  - Input data
  - Output
- explain that it is generated data
  - we can not know how it works on real data
- and how real data and more data can actually be good
  - daily data for stronger correlation
  - new datapoints
